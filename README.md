# scifi-name-generator

Very basic and quick script which takes an array of names and shifts 1-3 letters to make a slightly off sounding name. I came up with this idea after reading John Scalzi's excellent *Collapsing Empire* as the character names all seemed to be one or two letters off real names.

# usage

run the script using `node main.js` and it will generate 5 'male' and 5 'female' names.
